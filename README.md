## Dev

Despite the .nojekyll, it's an easy way to test this locally. 
Follow the instructions on the [Jekyll Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) page to install it, 
instantiate a Jekyll site in your local repo (the artifacts should already be gitignored), 
and serve the static pages locally. You don't need any of the features like templates, md, sass, etc.
since we only need to serve static pages.

Alternatively, serve the root directory with any local HTTP server.
